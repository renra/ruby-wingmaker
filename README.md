Hmm, just an evening play with ruby, but I think I'm beginning to see a pattern here. Classes are good for storing the state of an object while modules are better for actions that can be shared across many objects. Otherwise everything would be defined in modules and class would just include all the logic and be empty in and of itself. But who knows? Maybe that's the best way.
